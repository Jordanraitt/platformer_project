 # Platformer Game

**About**

This game is a basic beta of a single level, with inspiration taken from classic 16-bit platformers, like Super Mario Bros. and Metroidvania. The game is written in Java using the LibGdx framework.

Features of the game:

* The use of multiple screens, including a Welcome, Game Over and Win screen.
* Game has working sprite animations, for both the heroine and the enemies.
* Enemies that move backwards and forwards, and that will kill our heroine if she touches them.
* Spikes that will kill our heroine if she touches them.
* Coins scattered around the map, that add up to a score as she collects them.
