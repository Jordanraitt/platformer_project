# platformer_project

Goal: Create a simple 2D platformer, using Java and libGDX.
<b> MVP </b>
  * The game must have a character that can move left and right, and be able to jump.
  * The character must have three lives. When they lose all three lives the game is over.
  * The game must have a map, with various platforms/obstacles that require the player to navigate around.
  * The game must have enemies/environmental instances that cause damage to the player when they walk into the variables/enemies.

<b> EXTENSION </b>
  * The player should be able to attack enemies, rather than avoiding them.
  * The player should be able to select from multiple character types - each with their own advantages and disadvantages.
  * Each character type should also have special abilities.
  * The map should have coins/treasure that add up to an amount.

<b>ADVANCED EXTENSION </b>
  * When a player runs into an enemy, then a turn-based system should display. In this view, the player and enemy should be able to take alternate turns, where they can choose to attack, defend, use special ability or run.
